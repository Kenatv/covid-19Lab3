# COVID-19 in the United States (2020)  
### Proportional Symbol Map & Choropleth Map Detailing Covid-19 in the US

## Project Overview
This project visualizes county-level COVID-19 data across the United States for the year 2020 using two map types:

1. **Proportional Symbol Map** showing total COVID-19 case counts by county  
2. **Choropleth Map** showing COVID-19 case rates normalized by population  

Each of these have thier own use and functions for further analysis regarding Covid-19 in the year 2020
